About me
I'm a first-year master's student at the University of Maryland, College Park, and I'm studying Business Analytics. Drawing upon my previous work experience in customer service and marketing, I have developed a strong appreciation for the application of data-driven insights to prioritize the needs and experiences of both people & businesses. Driven by a deep passion for understanding human behavior and with a strong proficiency in both math and data analysis, my goal is to leverage the power of data science to foster stronger relationships between businesses and consumers.
